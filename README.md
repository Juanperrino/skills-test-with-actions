## Step 2: Fix the test

_Great job adding the templated workflow! :tada:_



When a GitHub Actions workflow is running, you should see some checks in progress, like the screenshot below.


You can follow along as GitHub Actions runs your job by going to the **Actions** tab or by clicking "Details" in the merge box below.

When the tests finish, you'll see a red X :x: or a green check mark :heavy_check_mark: in the merge box. At that point, you can access the logs for the build job and its associated steps.

_By looking at the logs, can you identify which tests failed?_ To find it, go to one of the failed builds and scroll through the log. Look for a section that lists all the unit tests. We're looking for the name of the test with an "x".


1. Wait about 20 seconds and then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
